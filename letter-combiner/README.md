## API COMBINADOR DE LETRAS

This project solves the problem of calculating the total cost of the trip by a route with precision.
This problem already occurs due to the lack of information, therefore the project provides the solution to the
development of an API Rest that performs the calculation of costs incurred on a journey that includes expenses
fixed and variable as well as the costs incurred in tolls according to the route.

In order to see the operation of this API, swagger will be used where the documentation will be. There you can
interact and find the route that suits you best.

to request our service.
